Disclaimer: This package contains the source code(s) to model and predict stock prices of stocks of companies with relatively stable stocks over time (with a given tolerance, limited by GARCH model). The mathematical formulation is based on Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model, Itô Lemma and Application to Stocks, and Brownian Motion. This was an academic project for an Advanced Probability class taken by the authors. The intent is purely academic, and authors don't take any responsibility whatsoever if applied elsewhere.

Coding Languages: C++, MATLAB
